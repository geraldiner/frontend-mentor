# Frontend Mentor Exercises
Here you'll find a collection of the exercises I complete for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

## How It's Made

Each project had a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Depending on the project and what I'm exploring or practicing at the time, they could also include: React, Vue, TailwindCSS, and more.

Check the README file in each exercise to see the specifics.
